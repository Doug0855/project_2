Things we need to do put "***" in front of number if you finish it

1) 	Rewrite setpower() to maximize (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-3-longest-increasing-subsequence/)

2) (COMPLETE?)	Create adjacency matrix to make graph
		a)	Edge lengths are number incantations

3) 	Implement Dijkstra's algo  to find least number incantions
	between realms
